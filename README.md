# Adelheid (or short: Adi)
Adelheid is an artefact database &amp; deployment monitor with a beautiful UI and an easy-to-use API. Her
purpose is to be informed about every deployment, so that she can tell you what is where in which version.

# Installation
You need a recent ruby installation with the builder gem ('''gem install builder'''). Then you can run
'''build''' to install all necessary ruby modules. If everything went fine '''rails s''' will start Adi.

# Getting Started...
You start by defining your target environments. This can be a host, but you can also decide to have
multiple environments on one host.

You can optionally put your environments in groups. This will result in a different layout in the UI.

Now let's take a look at your deployment scripts / applications - can they authenticate?
